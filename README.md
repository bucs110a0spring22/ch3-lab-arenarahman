## SUMMARY:
In part A, my code has turtle races where the first one consists of a single call forward for each turtle using random values. The second race uses a loop to move the turtles forward using random values from a range. In part B, I used my orange turtle to draw 5 regular polygons using a for loop that uses the calculated angles, which aren't hardcoded.
